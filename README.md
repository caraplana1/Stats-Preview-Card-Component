## My process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS coustume properties
* Media queries
* Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned flexbox, is really easy to use and with simple code you can poition your elements really well and really fast.

```
display: flex;
```

This way you make your container a flexbox and you are ready to work.

Also you can modify the elements positioning in your container like this

```
flex-direction: ;
justify-content: ;
aling-items: ;
```

Those are some of the attributes of flexbox.

I learned how to make a color filter with an image

```
mix-blend-mode: ;
filter: ;
```

### Continued Development
I woul like to improve my flexbox adn learn CSS grid
